Analyzers can be written in any programming language supported by Linux such 
as Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. Refer to the [How to Write and Submit an Analyzer](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/CortexDocs/blob/master/api/how-to-create-an-analyzer.md)
page for details on how to write and submit one.

To configure analyzers, please read the [Cortex Analyzer Requirements Guide](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/CortexDocs/blob/master/analyzer_requirements.md).

# License
**Unless specified otherwise**, analyzers are released under the [AGPL](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-analyzers/blob/master/LICENSE) (Affero General Public License).

If an analyzer is released by its author under a different license, the subfolder corresponding to it will contain a *LICENSE* file.

# Updates
Information, news and updates are regularly posted on [TheHive Project Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thehive_project) and on [the blog](https://blog.thehive-project.org/).

# Contributing
We welcome your **[contributions for new analyzers](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/CortexDocs/blob/master/api/how-to-create-an-analyzer.md)**
that can take away the load off overworked fellow analysts or improvements to existing ones. Please feel free to fork the code, play with it, make some patches and send us pull requests using [issues](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-analyzers/issues).

**Important**: To make it easy for every one, please send **one** pull request per analyzer. It will help us reviewing the code, and merging as soon as feasible.

We do have a [Code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md). Make sure to check it out before contributing.

# Support
